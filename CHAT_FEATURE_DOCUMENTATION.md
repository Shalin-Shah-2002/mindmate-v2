# MindMate Chat Feature Documentation

## 🎯 Overview
The MindMate chat feature provides safe, moderated communication for mental health support while protecting vulnerable users from exploitation. Navigation is available through the Community tab with a dedicated chat icon.

## 🛡️ Safety-First Approach
Given that MindMate serves individuals dealing with depression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges, user safety is our absolute priority.

### Core Safety Principles:
1. **Vulnerable User Protection**: Special safeguards for users in crisis
2. **Trust-Based Access**: Graduated permissions based on user reliability
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: AI-powered content filtering and crisis detection
4. **Professional Integration**: Direct connection to mental health resources
5. **Easy Reporting**: One-tap reporting and blocking capabilities

## 👥 User Trust Level System

### Trust Levels:
```

├── 2-hour daily chat limit
└── All messages pre-filtered by AI

VERIFIED (Email + Profile Complete)
├── Can join all group chats
├── Can send friend requests
├── 4-hour daily chat limit
└── Real-time message filtering

TRUSTED (90+ days + Good Standing)
