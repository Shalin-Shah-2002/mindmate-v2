# MindMate - Build Issues & Solutions

## Current Issue: NDK Version Conflict

The build is failing due to Android NDK version issues. Here are the solutions:

### Solution 1: Manual NDK Management (Recommended)
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Tools > SDK Manager
3. Go to SDK Tools tab
4. Uncheck "Show Package Details"
5. Check "NDK (Side by side)" and install version 25.1.8937393
6. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

### Solution 2: Use Web Platform for Testing
Instead of Android, you can run on web:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Solution 3: Alternative Build Configuration
If you continue having issues, we can:
1. Update gradle files to use older, more stable versions
2. Remove NDK dependency temporarily
3. Use Flutter web for initial development

### Current Status:
- ✅ All Dart code compiles without errors
- ✅ All packages installed successfully
- ✅ MVVM structure implemented
- ⚠️ Android build has NDK version conflict
- ✅ Project ready for web development

### Next Steps:
1. Test on web platform first
2. Implement core features (Auth, UI, etc.)
3. Return to Android build optimization later
